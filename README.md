# powerbi_gov_expenses_revenues
This project was developed in Power BI, using one database of the Transparency Portal of the federal government of Brazil.

The dashboard has five pages with various analyses of the Expenses and Revenues of the Federal Government of Brazil with Public Data.

I used some types of graphics to explain:
- Expected and actual expenditure.
- Expense incurred and function (expense allocation).
- Expenses versus Income.
- Details of expenses incurred.
- Details of the revenues made.

Dashboard is available in project files.

Database available on: https://portaldatransparencia.gov.br/

- This project was prepared in Portuguese.
